    "# What's the advantage and disadvantage of a lazy programming language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s first look at the advantage: it is all about liberation from things to think about. When we moved from C,C++ to Java, we did away with having to think when we would never need a value again, leaving that to garbage collection. Lazy evaluation does away with the need to know when a value needs to be created. The run-time system will decide that for you. Moreover, by leaving that to the compiler, it can typically apply many more optimisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then some disadvantages: laziness may not be very performant if you actually know that you certainly need a value. That it means to get performance, you will be strictifying your program to get rid of huge thunks being built on your heap. And when you start doing this, you will also sometimes evaluate things you did not have to. Also, lazy languages tend to be somewhat harder to analyze statically, so it puts a bigger burden on the compiler builder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Back to the analogy with C++ and Java: by leaving things to the run-time/compiler to decide, we also lose some control over the evaluation, in particular its resource consumption behavior. Finally, lazy languages tends to be hard to debug, because we do not know when things will happen, and debugging might even change the behavior of the program in a way that the bug does not show itself anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Oh yes, it does not really make sense to have a lazy language that is not pure. If you have no idea when the run-time will decide to have some side effects on a local variable (i.e perform an assignment), then you’d better not let the behavior of your program depend on it. So with laziness comes purity. If you do not want to be pure, don’t be lazy. Of course, many non-pure languages have “laziness on demand” (force/delay in Scheme for example).\n",
