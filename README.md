# Introduction to the Julia Programming Language

Julia is a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing. It provides a sophisticated compiler, distributed parallel execution, numerical accuracy, and an extensive mathematical function library.

This workshop introduces core concepts of modern programming languages by introducing Julia: a language designed for computational performance, and popular in the machine-learning community. In the first session participants learn about core concepts of modern programming languages and how they are realized in Julia. The second session covers the mechanics of distributed parallel computing, and the third session demonstrates the computational power of Julia programs using image processing and computer vision.


### Sessions
1. Participants learn about core concepts of modern programming languages and how they are realized in Julia.
2. Mechanics of distributed parallel computing: remote procedures and objects, message passing, queueing, and asynchronous execution.
3. Demonstration of the computational power of Julia programs using image processing and computer vision.

Participants should be familiar with common elements of programming languages, like variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions.
